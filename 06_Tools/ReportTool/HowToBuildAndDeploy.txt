1) Run _builddeploy.sh
  runs: _build.sh (build sources to binaries in sources/build folder)
  runs: _deploy.sh (copy binaries form build folder to runtime location)
2) Run _release.bat - this copies deployment to release folder
3) Zip directory release for copy-deployment purposes
4) Deploy (unzip) <zip>\release to ..\06_Tools\ReportTool\

Alternative for copy deployment (steps 2, 3 and 4) is synchronize via github
