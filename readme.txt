What is this and where to start

What it is: the ICTU performance testrunner (Teststraat) is created to run and evaluate performance tests autononimously, started manually or by CI/CD trigger.

Were to start: download all files and folders you can find from the root of this repository. Besides installing a loadgenerator (Silkperformer or JMeter) and some configuration (see documentation), the runner should work as is. All binaries needed for the execution are included in the repository. No need for compilation first.

Have fun!
